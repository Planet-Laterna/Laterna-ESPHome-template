# ESPHome Laterna Project Template

Her you find the ESPHome templates for Laterna and Laterna Stick RGB Controller.

This repo serves as a template for creating a new ESPHome project as described from the ESPHome team in their [Github Repository](https://github.com/esphome/esphome-project-template) 

It includes a GitHub workflow that will automatically build the configuration(s) and then deploys a simple 
website via GitHub pages that utilises [ESP Web Tools](https://esphome.github.io/esp-web-tools/) for users to 
easily install ESPHome on our Laterna RGB Controllers
